# MOSA-Hackathon-2024

**Guidelines**
You are free to use whatever language(s) for the MOSA Summer of Code Project, and there is no limit on the number or type(s) of framework(s) you will adopt. But you should keep all your code in a single GitHub org or repo, so that it will be better organised for the purposes of evaluation.
